# Github Repos
Get the github repos of a user. It doesn't want to work for more than 30 repos but I'm not gonna fix it. Useful for your website.

## How to use it
 Just load the script and do `fetchRepos(a, b);`, where a is the string wwith the username and b is the element of your html to append the list to. Check my [github pages code](https://github.com/jgc777/jgc777.github.io/blob/main/README.md) and the [demo code](https://github.com/jgc777/GitHub-repos/blob/main/demo/index.html)
## Output
 It generates a list with the name of the repos and the link to the github pages (if it has one) or the github repo.
 
## Demo
(It only shows in the web. If it doesn't work click [here](./demo/).

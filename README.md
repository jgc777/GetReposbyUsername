# GetReposbyUser
Get the github repos of a user. It doesn't want to show all the repos if they are more than 30 but I'm not gonna fix it.

## How to use it
 Just load [the script](./GetReposbyUser.js) and do `GetReposbyUser(a, b);`, where a is the string with the username and b is the element of your html to append the list to. Check my [github pages code](https://github.com/jgc777/jgc777.github.io/blob/main/README.md?plain=1) and the [demo code](https://github.com/jgc777/GetReposbyUser/blob/main/demo/index.html?plain=1).

## Output
 It generates a list with the name of the repos and the link to the github pages (if it has one) or the github repo.

## Demo
(It only shows in the web. If it doesn't work click [here](./demo/).

I would appreciate if you didn't remove the comment on the javascript code.

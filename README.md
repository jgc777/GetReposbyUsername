# Github Repos
Get the github repos of a user. It doesn't want to work for more than 30 repos but I'm not gonna fix it. Useful for your website.

## Output
 It generates a list with the name of the repos and the link to the github pages (if it has one) or the github repo.
 
## Demo
(It only shows in the web. If it doesn't work click [here](./demo/).)
